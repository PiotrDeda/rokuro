Rokuro is a work-in-progress C# game engine using [SDL](http://libsdl.org/), made as a master's thesis project.

## FAQ

### Should I use this?

As Rokuro is mostly a project made for educational purposes, I wouldn't recommended using it for any serious work. However, if you like to experiment with game engines and low-level games, feel free to take a look.

### How to create a game with this?

See the [relevant wiki page](https://github.com/PiotrDeda/rokuro/wiki/Creating-a-game).

### Why the name?

轆轤 (ろくろ, *rokuro*) means "potter's wheel" in Japanese, though the word is also used in [rokurokubi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokurokubi), a folklore creature with a long neck, a kind of monster one might see in a video game. I thought the name was fitting.
